# Grade Analyzer
A discord bot that provides functionalities for students and their course grades, such as predicting whether a student should take a certain course, displaying graphs of course grades, and comparing grades with other students.

## Privacy
Student and course grade information is stored in a database server on my Raspberry Pi. The data is only used for this application.

## Acknowledgments
Used [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enfZAaTRTKU&ab_channel=dcode) to help write code for training a neural network with BERT encodings of course names to make predictions.
